# AutoNanoHealth-Automated-Nanobot-Health-Management-System-
A comprehensive nanobot control system for medical applications, integrating ROS, Blender, and AI to automate treatment, detect diseases, and simulate nanobot behavior in the human body.




# Comprehensive Nanobot System Setup Script with Automation, Medical Integration, and ROS Customization
# This script handles the installation of all required dependencies and sets up an environment for medical nanobot simulations.
# It also integrates with Blender, ROS, and custom Python environments to allow automated treatment decisions based on patient data.


# AutoNanoHealth - Automated Nanobot Health Management System

**AutoNanoHealth** is an open-source system designed to simulate and manage medical nanobots for automated health applications. This system integrates **ROS**, **Blender**, and **Python** to automate treatment, detect diseases, and simulate nanobot behavior within the human body. It allows for:

- **Automated Dependency Setup**: Installs ROS, Blender, and Python libraries automatically.
- **Patient Data Management**: Stores patient conditions in a database with automated treatment assignment.
- **Blender & ROS Integration**: Visualizes nanobot movements and controls in real-time.

This project aims to provide a foundation for the development of advanced **nanobot-based health solutions**, allowing medical research, testing, and the potential for real-world applications.

## Features
- **Automated Installation** of required dependencies and setup of ROS and Blender environments.
- **Disease Detection**: Identifies and reports specific disease markers and assigns treatments.
- **Patient Database Management**: Collects patient data, manages multiple conditions, and assigns treatment plans.
- **Blender Visualization**: Simulates nanobot movement in a 3D environment.
- **ROS Integration**: Enables real-time communication for controlling nanobots.

Feel free to contribute and enhance the functionality!
